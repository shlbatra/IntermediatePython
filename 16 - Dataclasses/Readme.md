- Classes
    - Behavior as in methods
    - Data as in attributes
- blueprint for objects
- Behaviour driven class
    - use inheritance to change behavior
    - not have too many instance of that class
- Data driven class   -> dataclass in Python
    - create many instances
    - compare instances, order them , inspect the data

- Write classes faster and saves you time
- dataclass used for mantaining data
- built in __init__ method to create them fast, print and compare easily
- Features
    - 1. Write less code to reach the same result
    - 2. it allows immutability easily. ex not change owner of post 
    - 3. it allows to create easily defualt values for instance attributes 
    - 4. Have full control for attributes you create
    - 5. Force the user creating instance to use keywords
- Limitations
    - 1. If use frozen attributes then they dont change after instantiation - freeze entire class or not any. not selective attributes yet
