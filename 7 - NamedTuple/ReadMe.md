- namedtuple 
    - assign meaning to each position in tuple
    - allow for more readable, self documenting code 
    - used wherever regular tuples are used
    - add ability to access fields by name instead of position index 
- syntax
    - namedtuple(<name>,<fields> as iterable object)
    - create object of tuple -> objName = namedtuple(fieldvalues)
    - alternate way to create object -> objName = namedtuple._make([fieldvalues])
    - Methods on named tuple
        - objName.fieldname to access field value 
        - objName[0] to access field value by index 
        - objName._asdict() to access named tuple as a dictionary 
        - newP._fields to get field names
        - objName = objName._replace(fieldname=fieldvalue)  to update field value. require this way as tuples are immutable
